# Twitter-hatered-tweet-classification
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.  Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

Dataset is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech
